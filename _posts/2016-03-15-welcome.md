Welcome

Psychology is my passion and I am so glad you are here.  Since the age of 15, when I was asked to write a paper on what I wanted to be when I grew up, I have wanted to become a Registered Psychologist.  Now that I am one, I can help with a wide range of life issues and mental health problems using an assortment of evidenced-based treatments to help people improve their lives.  I feel privileged that people share their stories with me and afford me the opportunity to use my expertise to help them.  I gain an immense sense of gratitude from my work and for that, I am grateful.  Please take the time to review my site, I have tried to make it an informative and useful one.

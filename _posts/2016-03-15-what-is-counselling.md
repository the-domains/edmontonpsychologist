**What is Counselling?**

Counselling involves the development of a trusting relationship between a client and a trained professional that focuses on the client's concerns and difficulties. It a process designed to help you improve upon your understanding of yourself and your relationships, particularly around your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, and how these may have contributed to problems in your life. Counselling also provides you with opportunities to examine how to tap into existing resources or develop new ones that can enhance your life and relationships. Counselling is a collaborative effort as it involves you and I working together to identify goals. 

**The Benefits of Counselling**

Counselling can benefit most people. Through raising awareness, more and more people are realizing just how widespread mental health and relationship issues are, and how psychologists, as active members of your healthcare team, can, and do, provide transformational outcomes.

As your psychologist, I can help you with many kinds of problems. Some people may come to see me because they have felt depressed, angry, or anxious for a long time. Others come for help because of a chronic condition that is interfering with their lives. While others have short-term problems they want help navigating such as feeling overwhelmed or grieving the death of a loved one. As a psychologist, I can help you learn to cope with stressful situations and break past barriers that keep you from reaching your goals.

I received my Masters of Science degree in Marital and Family Therapy from Loma Linda University and went on to obtain my Registered Psychologist qualification.  My work in marriage and family therapy is based on research findings that clearly indicate that individuals and their problems are best seen in context, particularly the context of the family. As such, my training in psychotherapy and family systems gears me towards bringing a family-oriented perspective to mental health care, delivered in a person-centered, safe, non-judgmental, and nurturing environment. This knowledge and approach channels my abilities into helping clients, either individuals, couples or families, resolve difficulties in a number of areas.

I also have a strong interest in crisis management, clinical psychology, Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), and psycho-education. I have experience working on the local adult crisis response team, treating patients with clinical disorders in the community care setting, teaching in the college setting, at corporate seminars, and offering coaching sessions in a variety of topics ranging from anger management to couples communication.

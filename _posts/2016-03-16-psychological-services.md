# Psychological Services

**Telephone Consultation - FREE**

Speak with me first.  Throughout my career, I have helped numerous individuals, couples and families with their life issues and mental health problems. I approach every person with care and compassion. If your current circumstances are negatively affecting your life and if you are confused about what to do next, [call me][0].

**Individual Therapy**

The opportunity to work one-on-one in a supportive and non-judgmental environment to explore your thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and interpersonal relationships.

**Couple Therapy**

Most couples can benefit from couples counselling.  If your partner is not interested in counselling, did you know that couples therapy can be achieved with just one partner?

**Family Therapy**

Every family member has a perspective, family therapy provides the opportunity for each family member to be respectfully heard.

**Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)**

EMDR is an integrative psychotherapy approach that has been proven effective in the treatment of trauma.  It is a set of standardized protocols drawing from many different treatment approaches.  EMDR has helped over 2 million people worldwide relieve psychological distress.  Have a look at[this page][1]for more information.  

**Marriage Preparation**

Getting married or re-married? Then this personalized session is for you. 

**Relationship Enrichment**

Your relationship is relatively healthy, but you would like to do a little fine-tuning. If this is you, then the relationship enrichment session is ideal.  You can choose between one 3 hour session or two 1.5 hour sessions.

**Coaching Session**

Everyone could use a little coaching sometimes. The coaching session is a psycho-educational approach to help you learn about a topic of interest in a supportive atmosphere geared towards teaching you real skills.

Coaching sessions are available as either one 3 hour session, or two 1.5 hour sessions. Topics include: anger management, communication skills, conflict resolution, self-esteem issues, parenting issues, and stress management.  Other topics may be available upon request.   

If the type of coaching session you would like is not listed here, please [contact me][2] so I might tailor a program to your specific needs.

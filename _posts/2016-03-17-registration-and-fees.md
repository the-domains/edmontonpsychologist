## Fees

Fees are commensurate with the recommended fee schedule of the Psychologists' Association of Alberta.  At the time of each appointment, fees are to be paid in full and a receipt will be provided.  Cash or email money transfer only.  Cheques are not accepted.  A fee will be charged for any reports and/or letters written on your behalf, and for any phone calls made or received on your behalf to or from a third party at the regular rate in 15 minute billing increments.  Receipts not submitted for reimbursements may be tax deductible.  A small fee is charged for the reproduction of receipts. 

## Cancellations and Missed Appointments

Your counselling requires that I reserve a significant amount of time exclusively for your benefit (the appointment, preparation, and travel time).  I have a policy regarding cancellations and missed appointments that I believe is fair to you, myself, and other clients needing appointments.  Because the appointment is reserved exclusively for you, I will charge the established hourly fee for appointments that are not cancelled 24 hours in advance.  In the event of an emergency, an exception to this agreement may be made at my discretion; if I determine your reason for canceling late/missing your appointment constitutes an emergency.  If an emergency arises, please telephone me as soon as possible.   

Please note: charges for missed appointments cannot be submitted for health insurance reimbursement

## Your Appointment

Services are offered by appointment only.  Appointment dates and times are flexible and daytime and evening appointments may be available.  Please contact me for further information.  

The length of each therapeutic hour is approximately 50 minutes, leaving me 10 minutes to tend to your file prior to, and after, meeting with you. 

## Intake

At the end of your free 20-minute telephone consultation, we will decide together whether or not it would be appropriate for us to schedule an appointment.  At this time, I will ask you to provide me with your name, address, availability, as well as the general nature, if not previously discussed, of the issue for which you are seeking counselling.  

Clients who have extended healthcare benefits through their employer, Blue Cross, or other health insurance provider may be reimbursed for all or a portion of their fees.

It is widely assumed that severe emotional pain requires a long time to heal.  EMDR therapy shows that the mind can in fact heal from psychological trauma much as the body recovers from physical trauma.  When you cut your hand, your body works to close the wound.  If a foreign object or repeated injury irritates the wound, it festers and causes pain.  Once the block is removed, healing resumes.  EMDR therapy demonstrates that a similar sequence of events occurs with mental processes.  The brain’s information processing system naturally moves toward mental health.  If the system is blocked or imbalanced by the impact of a disturbing event, the emotional wound festers and can cause intense suffering.  Once the block is removed, healing resumes.  Using the detailed protocols and procedures learned in EMDR training sessions, clinicians help clients activate their natural healing processes.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="67"><p>Twenty positive controlled outcome studies have been done on EMDR.  Some of the studies show that 84%-90% of single-trauma victims no longer have post-traumatic stress disorder after only three 90-minute sessions.  Another study, funded by the HMO Kaiser Permanente, found that 100% of the single-trauma victims and 77% of multiple trauma victims no longer were diagnosed with PTSD after only six 50-minute sessions. In another study, 77% of combat veterans were free of PTSD in 12 sessions. There has been so much research on EMDR that it is now recognized as an effective form of treatment for trauma and other disturbing experiences by organizations such as the American Psychiatric Association, the World Health Organization and the Department of Defense. Given the worldwide recognition as an effective treatment of trauma, you can easily see how EMDR would be effective in treating the “everyday” memories that are the reason people have low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, and all the myriad problems that bring them in for therapy. Over 100,000 clinicians throughout the world use the therapy.  Millions of people have been treated successfully over the past 25 years.<br></p></div></div></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="68"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="69"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="70"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="71"><h1 data-reactid="72"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="73"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="74">Psychological Services</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 75 --><!-- react-empty: 76 --><!-- react-empty: 77 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="78"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="79"><p></p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="80"><p>Speak with me first.  Throughout my career, I have helped numerous individuals, couples and families with their life issues and mental health problems.

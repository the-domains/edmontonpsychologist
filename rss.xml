            <title><![CDATA[Eye Movement Desensitization &Reprocessing (EMDR)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Eye Movement Desensitization &Reprocessing (EMDR)</h1><p>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a psychotherapy that enables people to heal from the symptoms and emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life experiences.  Repeated studies show that by using EMDR people can experience the benefits of psychotherapy that once took years to make a difference. It is widely assumed that severe emotional pain requires a long time to heal.  EMDR therapy shows that the mind can in fact heal from psychological trauma much as the body recovers from physical trauma.  When you cut your hand, your body works to close the wound.  If a foreign object or repeated injury irritates the wound, it festers and causes pain.  Once the block is removed, healing resumes.  EMDR therapy demonstrates that a similar sequence of events occurs with mental processes.  The brain’s information processing system naturally moves toward mental health.  If the system is blocked or imbalanced by the impact of a disturbing event, the emotional wound festers and can cause intense suffering.  Once the block is removed, healing resumes.  Using the detailed protocols and procedures learned in EMDR training sessions, clinicians help clients activate their natural healing processes.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[About Me]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Me</h1><p>I received my Masters of Science degree in Marital and Family Therapy from Loma Linda University and went on to obtain my Registered Psychologist qualification.  My work in marriage and family therapy is based on research findings that clearly indicate that individuals and their problems are best seen in context, particularly the context of the family. As such, my training in psychotherapy and family systems gears me towards bringing a family-oriented perspective to mental health care, delivered in a person-centered, safe, non-judgmental, and nurturing environment. This knowledge and approach channels my abilities into helping clients, either individuals, couples or families, resolve difficulties in a number of areas.</p></article>]]></description>
